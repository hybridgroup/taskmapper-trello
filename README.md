# taskmapper-trello


This is the [TaskMapper][] for interaction with [Trello][]

## Usage

Initialize the Trello TaskMapper instance using your public key and member
token:

```ruby
trello = TaskMapper.new(
  :taskmapper,
  :developer_public_key => "YOUR_DEVELOPER_PUBLIC_KEY",
  :member_token => "YOUR_MEMBER_TOKEN"
)
```

To find your `developer_public_key`, go to
[https://trello.com/1/appKey/generate][key].

To get a `member_token` you can use ad infinitum, modify this URL and visit it in
a browser:

    https://trello.com/1/authorize?key=APPLICATION_KEY&scope=read%2Cwrite&name=taskmapper-trello&expiration=never&response_type=token

After confirming, you'll be given a `member_token` that should not
expire.


[key]: https://trello.com/1/appKey/generate#
[token]: https://trello.com/1/appKey/generate#
